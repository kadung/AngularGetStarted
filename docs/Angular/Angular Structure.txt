    Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ The Angular project contains following items:
    1. src folder: contains all Angular components, templates, styles, images, and anything else your 
    angular app needs go here. Any files outside of this folder are meant to support building the app.

    2. e2e folder: contains all end to end protractor test script to test angular application.

    3. node_modules folder: contains all nodejs third party modules listed in package.json.

    4. editorconfig: Simple configuration for the editor to make sure everyone that uses the project 
    has the same basic configuration.

    5. angular.json: is the configuration file for Angular CLI. In this, you can set several defaults 
    and also configure what files are included when your project is built.

    6. package.json: npm(similar to maven) configuration listing the third party nodejs packages the 
    project uses.

    7. tsconfig.json: TypeScript compiler configuration for IDE to pick up and give helpful tooling.

    8. tslint.json: Linting configuration for TSLint together with Codelyzer, used when running 
        ng lint
    Linting helps keep your code style consistent.

    src folder
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ app folder: contais all components and each component is a folder which contains bewlow files:
    - app.component.css         Component CSS stylesheet
    - app.component.html        Component HTML template
    - app.component.spec.ts     Component unit test
    - app.component.ts          Component metadata and functional class

+ app/app.modules.ts: declare each thing you create in Angular, and group them together

+ assets folder: where you can put images and anything else to be copied wholesale when you build your 
application.

+ environments folder: contains one file for each of your destination environments, each exporting 
simple configuration variables to use in your application. The files are replaced on-the-fly when you 
build your app. You might use a different API endpoint for development than you do for production or 
maybe different analytics tokens. You might even use some mock services.

+ browserslist: A configuration file to share target browsers between different front-end tools.

+ favicon.ico: Title or bookmark icon.

+ index.html: The main HTML page that is served when someone visits your site. Most of the time you'll 
never need to edit it. The CLI automatically adds all js and css files when building your app so you 
never need to add any <script> or <link> tags here manually.

+ karma.conf.js: Unit test configuration for the Karma test runner, used when running ng test.

+ main.ts: The main entry point for your app. JIT compilation (recommend for development) is the default 
when you run ng build and ng serve CLI commands, You can also use the AOT compiler (recommend for 
production) without changing any code by appending the --aot flag to the ng build and ng serve.

+ polyfills.ts: help normalize different levels of support of the web standards for different browsers.

+ styles.css: centralize global styles which affect all of the app but you also create local styles in 
your components for easier maintenance.

+ test.ts: main entry point for your unit tests.

+ tsconfig.app.json: TypeScript compiler configuration for the Angular ap.

+ tsconfig.spec.json: TypeScript compiler configuration for the unit test.

+ tslint.json: Additional Linting configuration for TSLint together with Codelyzer, used when running:
ng lint (Linting helps keep your code style consistent.)
