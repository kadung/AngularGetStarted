-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Angular team strongly recommend to move filter and sort logic into the component

+ For example:
    - We have a "products" variable which contains all data query from backend service. 
    - We have a "fiterCriteria" variable which contains filtered value from user.
    - To do the filter the list of products:
        1. Define new variable "filteredProducts" which contains filtered value from "products". We do 
        not do the filter direct on "products" variable because we will lose our original data and only
        get it back until we query the backend service again.

        2. To identify when user changes the filter criteria, we change the "fiterCriteria" variable to
        into a getter and a setter variable and we also perform filter logic with the change value in 
        the setter method:
            _fiterCriteria: string;
            get fiterCriteria(): string{
                return this._fiterCriteria;
            }
            set fiterCriteria(value: string): string{
                return this._fiterCriteria = value;
                // Filter logic with value (filter criteria)
            }
        Getter and Setter variable work just like the simple variable. 
            - When the data binding needs the value, it will call the getter to get the value
            - When user modifies the value, the data binding calls the setter to send the change value

        3. Set default value for filteredProducts = products in component constructor
