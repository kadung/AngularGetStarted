    Services and Dependency Injection
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ A service is class with focus purpose to do something specific and do it well. It is used for:
    - Implement functionality that is independent from any particular component.
    - Provide shared data or logic across component.
    - Encapsulate external interaction such as data access.
Example: logging service, data service, application configuration, ...

+ Dependency Injection (DI) is a coding pattern in which a class receives the instance of the class
it needs (called dependency) from an external source rather than creating them itself. Angular uses
DI to provide new component with the required services without locally instantiate service class.

+ In Angular, external source is Angular dependency injector. It maintains a container of single
service instance of each registered service class. If a component needs a service, it defines the
service as a dependency then the injector will provide/inject the service instance to the component
class.

+ Hierarchical of angular dependency injector:
    - Root injector: share same instance of Service everywhere in the whole application.
    - Component injector: share same instance of Service to a specific component and its child
    component. The instances don't propagate up, they only go down that tree of that component.

//// Note: If the child component register same service as root or parent component, then it uses
//// a different instance of service with root or parent component.

    Create and Inject a service to an component
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Create the service class :
    - Using name as *.service.ts
    - Define metatdata for service class with @Injectable decorator
        @Injectable()
        export class SomeServiceClass {}

+ Register the service to Angular dependency injector:
    - Register the service in root injector in Angular 6:
        @Injectable({
            providedIn: 'root'
        })
        export class SomeServiceClass {}

    - Register the service in root injector in Angular below 6:
        @NgModule({
            ...
            providers: [SomeServiceClass]
        })
        export class AppModule {}

    - Or register the service in component injector:
        @Component({
            ...
            providers: [SomeServiceClass]
        })
        export class ComponentClass {}

+ Inject the service instance to component class:
    export class ComponentClass {
        private _serviceInstance;
        constructor(serviceIntance: SomeServiceClass){
            this._serviceInstance = serviceIntance;
        }
    }
Or we can use shortcut syntax from TypeScript for DI:
    export class ComponentClass {
        constructor(private serviceIntance: SomeServiceClass){}
    }
