    HTTP Interception
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ With interception, we declare interceptors that inspect and transform HTTP requests from the app
to the server. The same interceptors may also inspect and transform the server's responses on their
way back to the app.

+ Interceptors can perform a variety of implicit tasks, from authentication to logging, in a routine,
standard way, for every HTTP request/response.
