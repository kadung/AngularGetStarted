    Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ In our Angular apps, we write HTML markup that becomes our interactive application, but browser 
only understands a limited set of markup tags, for example <b>, <select>, <form>, ... and all have 
functionality defined by our browser creator.

+ What if we want to teach the browser new tags? What if we wanted to have a <weather> tag that
shows the weather? Or what if we want to create a <login> tag that shows a login panel? This is the 
fundamental idea behind components: we will teach browser new tags that have custom functionality 
attached to them.
