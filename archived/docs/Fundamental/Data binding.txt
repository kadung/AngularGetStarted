    What Is Data Binding?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Data binding is the process that establishes a connection between an application UI element and a 
data source. 

+ There are 2 types of data binding:
    1. Two-way data binding: 
        - Information flow is in both direction. So when the data changes its value, the element which 
        is bound to the data reflect changes automatically and vice versa. 
        - For example, you have a variable "X" in database and you bind it with an input textbox in UI, 
        so input textbox displays value of "X", then:
            . If the value of "X" is changed in the database then UI textbox automatically updates the 
            change
            . If an user updates the value of the textbox then the value of "X" automatically updates 
            to the value of "X" in databse

    2. One-way data binding:
        - Information flows is in only one direction, typicaly from the data source to the element.
        This makes the data read-only from the user's perspective.
        - With the same above example, then:
            . If the value of "X" is changed in the database then UI textbox automatically updates the 
            change
            . If an user updates the value of the textbox then the value of "X" does not automatically 
            updates to database. And this action is manually trigger by an event.
